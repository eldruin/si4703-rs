This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the Si4703 and Si4702 FM radio turners
(receivers) using the [`embedded-hal`] traits and I2C.

This driver allows you to:
- Enable/disable the device. See: `enable()`.
- Mute/unmute. See: `mute()`.
- Configure seek. See: `configure_seek()`.
- Seek with/without STC interrupts. See: `seek_with_stc_int_pin()`.
- Tune a frequency with/without STC interrupts. See: `tune_with_stc_int_pin()`.
- Set volume. See: `set_volume()`.
- Set band. See: `set_band()`.
- Set channel spacing. See: `set_channel_spacing()`.
- Set the GPIO1, GPIO2 and GPIO3 function/status. See: `set_gpio1()`.
- Enable/disable softmute. See: `enable_softmute()`.
- Enable/disable auto gain control. See: `enable_auto_gain_control()`.
- Enable/disable oscillator. See: `enable_oscillator()`.
- Enable/disable STC interrupts. See: `enable_stc_interrupts()`.
- Enable/disable audio High-Z. See: `enable_audio_high_z()`.
- Set de-emphasis. See: `set_deemphasis()`.
- Set stereo to mono blend level. See: `set_stereo_to_mono_blend_level()`.
- Set stereo/mono output mode. See: `set_output_mode()`.
- Read output mode. See: `output_mode()`.
- Read channel. See: `channel()`.
- Read device ID. See: `device_id()`.
- Read chip ID. See: `chip_id()`.
- Reset and select I2C communication using several methods. See: `reset_and_select_i2c_method1()`.
- RDS/RBDS (only on Si4703):
    - Enable/disable RDS. See: `enable_rds()`.
    - Enable/disable RDS interrupts. See: `enable_rds_interrupts()`.
    - Read whether a new RDS group is ready. See: `rds_ready()`.
    - Read whether RDS is synchronized. See: `rds_synchronized()`.
    - Read RDS data. See: `rds_data()`.
    - Decode RDS radio text from RDS data. See: `get_rds_radio_text()`.
    - Fill char array with decoded RDS radio text from RDS data. See: `fill_with_rds_radio_text()`.

## The devices

The Si4702/03-C19 extends Silicon Laboratories Si4700/Si4701 FM tuner
family, and further increases the ease and attractiveness of adding FM
radio reception to mobile devices through small size and board area,
minimum component count, flexible programmability, and superior, proven
performance.

The device offers significant programmability, and caters to the
subjective nature of FM listeners and variable FM broadcast environments
world-wide through a simplified programming interface and
mature functionality.

The Si4703-C incorporates a digital processor for the European Radio Data
System (RDS) and the US Radio Broadcast Data System (RBDS) including all
required symbol decoding, block synchronization, error detection, and
error correction functions.

RDS enables data such as station identification and song name to be
displayed to the user. The Si4703-C offers a detailed RDS view and a
standard view, allowing adopters to selectively choose granularity of RDS
status, data, and block errors.

## Usage

To use this driver, import this crate and an `embedded_hal` implementation,
then instantiate the appropriate device.

In the following example an instance of the device Si4703 will be created.
An instance of the Si4702 device can be created with the method:
`Si4703::new_si4702(...)`.

Please find additional examples using hardware in this repository: [driver-examples]

```rust
use embedded_hal::blocking::delay::DelayMs;
use linux_embedded_hal::{Delay, I2cdev, Pin};
use nb::block;
use si4703::{
    reset_and_select_i2c_method1, ChannelSpacing, DeEmphasis, SeekDirection, SeekMode, Si4703,
    Volume,
};

fn main() {
    let mut delay = Delay {};
    {
        // Reset and communication protocol selection must be done beforehand
        let mut sda = Pin::new(2);
        let mut rst = Pin::new(17);
        reset_and_select_i2c_method1(&mut rst, &mut sda, &mut delay).unwrap();
    }
    let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
    let mut radio = Si4703::new(dev);
    radio.enable_oscillator().unwrap();
    // Wait for the oscillator to stabilize
    delay.delay_ms(500_u16);
    radio.enable().unwrap();
    // Wait for powerup
    delay.delay_ms(110_u16);

    radio.set_volume(Volume::Dbfsm28).unwrap();
    radio.set_deemphasis(DeEmphasis::Us50).unwrap();
    radio.set_channel_spacing(ChannelSpacing::Khz100).unwrap();
    radio.unmute().unwrap();

    let stc_int = Pin::new(27);
    // Seek using STC interrupt pin
    block!(radio.seek_with_stc_int_pin(SeekMode::Wrap, SeekDirection::Up, &stc_int)).unwrap();
    let channel = radio.channel().unwrap_or(-1.0);
    println!("Found channel at {:1} MHz", channel);
}
